Book Recommender System
This repository contains code and resources for building a book recommender system. The recommender system suggests books to users based on their preferences, past interactions, and similarities with other users.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of information about books, users, and their interactions. It includes attributes such as book titles, authors, genres, user ratings, and reviews. The dataset may be obtained from various sources, such as Goodreads, Amazon, or custom datasets.

Techniques
Several techniques are explored in this project for building the recommender system, including:

Collaborative Filtering
Content-Based Filtering
Matrix Factorization (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition)
Hybrid Approaches (combining collaborative and content-based methods)
Deep Learning Models (e.g., Neural Collaborative Filtering)
File Structure
data/: Contains the dataset files.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis.
scripts/: Python scripts for model implementation, utility functions, and evaluation metrics.
